	Fixed sealing of hashes for restoring PCRs after S3 resume
	Misc. fixes and code cleanup

20080523:
	Updated TrouSerS version to 0.3.1 and to download it from its SF site
	Fixed several items regarding TPM:
	      call TPM_SaveState in case launching kernel that does not, so
	          that S3 resume will restore SRTM PCRs
	      support for TPMs with an Idle state
	      fixed timeout values per TCG spec
	      enforce that TPM is activated and enabled (or fail launch)
	      misc. fixes

	Revised the docs/policy.txt steps
	Code and build re-factoring and cleanup (default target is now 'build')
	Make memory logging build-time optional and disable by default
	Support >2 cores/threads
	Move tboot to load and execute at 16MB (this also now protects it from
	    dom0 access since it's memory type can be E820_UNUSABLE now)
	    *** this requires a patch to Xen ***
	The Xen command line shoudl have 'no-real-mode' removed and 'vtd=1'
	    added (as indicated in the updated docs/tboot-info.txt)
	    setting 'vtd=1' is optional but some systems fail to boot dom0
	    otherwise
	    *** setting 'vtd=1' will cause S3 resume to fail ***
	Updated trousers sub-directory to download 0.3.1 version from TrouSerS
	    SourceForge site and build it

20071029:
	Moved build_tools target into top-level Makefile
	Put 'tboot=0x1234' (where 1234 is the addr of the tboot_shared data)
	    on VMM/kernel command line, per latest Xen feedback
	Changed TB_LAUNCH_ERR_IDX to 0x20000002
	Made TPM detailed debug ouput conditional
	Changes TBOOT_S3_WAKEUP_ADDR to 0x8a000 to ensure no conflicts
