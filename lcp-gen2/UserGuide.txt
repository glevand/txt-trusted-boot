#This is a UserGuide for LCP v3 Creator
1. Introduction
This document describes how to install and use the 2nd generation of Launch Control Policy creation tool for creating Intel® TXT launch
control policies for use with TPM 2.0 family devices.
This LCP tool can be used to build one or more Policy Definition (PDEF) files and, using a PDEF file,
can create policy files for use with Intel TXT. Intel TXT launch control policy consists of NV Policy Data
stored in the TPM NVRAM and a Policy List Structure file that is stored either in the BIOS flash ROM (for
Platform Supplier policy) or in the boot directory of the target platform (for Platform Owner policy).
This tool creates/edits a Policy Definition File (PDEF). The PDEF identifies files that contain the data for
building the NV Policy Data and Data List Structure. All source data files must be in the working
directory. The GUI updates the PDEF structure and when the user selects “BUILD”, the tool creates the
policy files based on the information in the PDEF file.

The tool allows the user to:
- Open an existing PDEF file or create a new one.
- Save the open definition to a new file name.
- Build the NV Policy Data and Policy List Structure based on the open PDEF.

The output files are:
- *.txt – TPM NV Policy data in readable text format (for DOS provisioning tools)
- *.pol – TPM NV Policy data in raw format for provisioning tools that take unformatted data.
- *.dat – file that contains the associated Policy List Structure

2. Installation
This tool is written in Python, so Python 2.7.x installation is needed to run the tool.
Besides Python 2.7, following Python packages installation are required as well:
- python-wxpython28
- M2Crypto 
- PyAsn1

3. Running the tool
The tool provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to edit and create the launch control policies.
The tool can be started by typing following command in a termainal from tool's working directory:
./TxtPolicyGen2.py

4. LCP Creation
TBD

Troubleshooting
- The tool can only be run from its working directory
- It is preferred to run the tool as a non-root user
- Create a new PDEF before editing the policy in tool's GUI
